####  Questions and Answers ####

#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

var - This is the old way. You can have it anywhere in function and can declare it again if you like.

let - Newer thing. Works only in the block where it’s written. You can always change the value later, but you can’t declare it twice.

const - you only have to do it once! Can't change after that.

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

forEach - Only loop through each item in the array. Doesn't give you anything back.

map- transform each thing! and receive a new full array back.

filter - Take only the stuff you want, using a rule.

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

Shorter way to write functions is all. Use => instead of the word function. When they do that with this one, they act a little differently.

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

Reach into objects or arrays without having to write a bunch lines. Makes code look cleaner.

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Place variables inside strings with the help of backticks and ${}. A lot better than concatenating strings with + signs. Works with multiple lines too.
